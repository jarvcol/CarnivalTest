# CarnivalTest

Test of the following requirements
1) Escenario de login inválido. Completed. 
This scenario could have been improve if I change the hardcoded data and move it to the feature file.

2) Escenario búsqueda de Cruceros. Completed.
Builder pattern was not implemented on this case. It could have been implemented to create the tasks objects that performs the SearchCruise.

3) Añadir habilidad al actor. Not implemented

4) API test. Under development on branch addApiTesting.

To run it it is just needed to have JAVA 1.8+ and maven installed. PLease run: mvn verify.

Thanks!
